        {"id": "p1", "text": "Machine learning algorithms have revolutionized how we approach data analysis. Recent advancements in neural networks have enabled computers to recognize patterns that were previously only detectable by human experts. This breakthrough has significant implications across multiple industries including healthcare, finance, and transportation."},
        {"id": "p2", "text": "Climate change presents one of the most significant challenges of our time. Research indicates that global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1Â°C since pre-industrial times. This warming has led to increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems worldwide. Urgent action is needed to mitigate these effects through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation strategies."},
        {"id": "p3", "text": "The human genome project completed in 2003 mapped approximately 20,500 genes in human DNA. This landmark scientific achievement has facilitated numerous breakthroughs in our understanding of genetic diseases and potential treatments. CRISPR gene editing technology builds upon this foundation, offering promising avenues for addressing previously untreatable conditions through precise genetic modifications."}
